# Hello 

Hello. I am a Tokyo-based software engineer and creator of [Nuita](https://nuita.net/). Nuita is a nice project. I'm glad you like it.

Currently I am working as a full-time software engineer. However, to spend more time on this nice project, I am looking for a part-time job for 2022.

I have some nice skills described below:

- Backend (Ruby, PHP, Go)
- Infrastructure, Cloud Engineering (AWS(SAA), GCP, Terraform, Docker)
- Frontend (HTML/CSS, TypeScript)

Please contact me on [email](mailto:kyp@kmc.gr.jp) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_kypu_)!
